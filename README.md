# bromomethane

a fork of [the Balatro Mod Manager by Skyline](https://github.com/skyline69/balatro-mod-manager/) that includes all my contributions that are held back in feature branches or were lost/broken by rebase mistakes, as well as a space for experimenting with suggestions and feature requests that BMM's author refused. i've put in some work to clean up code i don't like and remove features i think are unneccessary, and i intend to work on bigger cleanups and refactors.
